# FlightBookingSystem

The main purpose of this system is to mechanise booking operations predominantly by
computerisation. In this program I have create an interactive ‘prototype’ booking management
application to focus on basic operations in a flight booking system like adding new flights, new
passengers, searching flights and passengers and facility to make and cancel bookings; also to
update information about bookings and passengers. The application should store all the
information about bookings and customers in a persistent storage e.g. files. 
The implementation is then extended into a GUI application which can be loaded using MainWindow.

This program is fully developed in Java and it was used for my assignment for the OOP Unit.
